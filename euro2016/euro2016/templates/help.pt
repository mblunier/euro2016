  <h3>Frequently Answered Questions</h3>
  <dl class="align-left">
    <dt>How do I register?</dt>
    <dd>To register you need a unique alias.
        The password prevents, that somebody may enter tips in your name, but don't use a precious password.
        <strong>Make sure to remember your password since a forgotten password cannot be
        restored and setting a new one is currently not possible...</strong>
        Entering a mail address is mandatory, but I promise it won't be abused beyond usual spamming.
        For statistical purposes each player may select its organizational unit/category.
        </dd>
    <dt>I can not register myself.</dt>
    <dd>Do you see an <strong>error</strong> message? Follow it.
        No message? Follow it anyway.
        </dd>
    <dt>I can not log in.</dt>
    <dd>Does your browser accept cookies? If not, you should let it accept cookies at least from this site.
        </dd>
    <dt>How do I change my personal information?</dt>
    <dd>After logging in select 'Profile' from the 'Help' menu and you will see a form where you can change
        your name and mail address as well as the organizational unit/category.
	</dd>
    <dt>What's this browser thing?</dt>
    <dd>In contrast to common understanding a browser is not intended to display internet pages, but merely to
        recognize people with lots of spare time and willing to participate in games like this one.
        By visiting this site you have unmasked yourself and you will be spammed from now on with similar offers.
        Resistance is futile, you have been assimilated.
	</dd>
    <dt>Something seems not to work correctly.</dt>
    <dd>First, you should as always <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/R/RTFM.html">do this</a>.
        Then assert, that the reason is not <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/P/PEBKAC.html">this kind</a> of problem.
        Despite the utmost care and although only the <a href="http://www.vim.org/">most advanced technology</a> was
	applied for the development of this game - not to speak about the ridiculous consumption of resources - there
	remains an extremely tiny chance of errors.
        In this case you may trustingly contact the <a href="mailto:${contact}?subject=${project}">helpdesk</a>,
        where your issues will be answered with well-pretended sympathy and - in exceptional cases - solved.
